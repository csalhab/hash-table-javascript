# Hash Table - Javascript

## Description

Hash Tables are a Data Structure that allow you to create a list of paired values (aka key/value pairs). You can then using the key, retrieve its value.

A Hash Table transforms a key into an integer index using a hash function, and the index will decide where to store the key/value pair in memory.
